This program is a fractal program that creates mazes on Sony PSP.  The code is actually very simple and can run on any computing device with the basic ascii character set.  The reason it is on the Sony PSP is because it was first made on that device.  Porting it is simple.  You can even use print statements as long as you have character output on the device.  I invented this simplest way to create mazes when I was in elementary school. The code is based on fractal generation, whereby simple repeating patterns can generate complex solutions.
